Tutorial 1: Random Field Generation
===================================

The main feature of GSTools is the spatial random field generator :any:`SRF`,
which can generate random fields following a given covariance model.
The generator provides a lot of nice features, which will be explained in
the following

GSTools generates spatial random fields with a given covariance model or
semi-variogram. This is done by using the so-called randomization method.
The spatial random field is represented by a stochastic Fourier integral
and its discretised modes are evaluated at random frequencies.

GSTools supports arbitrary and non-isotropic covariance models.

"""
From bigaussian to plurigaussian simulation
--------------------------------------------------

In many PGS implementations, the dimensions of the simulation domain often
matches the number of fields that are supplied. However, this is not a
requirement of the PGS algorithm. In fact, it is possible to use multiple
spatial random fields in PGS, which can be useful for more complex lithotype
definitions. In this example, we will demonstrate how to use multiple SRFs in
PGS. In GSTools, this is done by utlising the tree based architecture.

Typically, PGS in two dimensions is carried out as a bigaussian simulation,
where two random fields are used. Here, we will employ four. We begin by
setting up the simulation domain and generating the necessary random fields,
where the length scales of two of the fields are much larger than the other two.

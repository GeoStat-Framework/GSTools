Tutorial 2: The Covariance Model
================================

One of the core-features of GSTools is the powerful :any:`CovModel`
class, which allows you to easily define arbitrary covariance models by
yourself. The resulting models provide a bunch of nice features to explore the
covariance models.


A covariance model is used to characterize the
`semi-variogram <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram#Semivariogram>`_,
denoted by :math:`\gamma`, of a spatial random field.
In GSTools, we use the following form for an isotropic and stationary field:

.. math::
   \gamma\left(r\right)=
   \sigma^2\cdot\left(1-\mathrm{cor}\left(r\right)\right)+n

Where:
  - :math:`\mathrm{cor}(r)` is the so called
    `correlation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocovariance#Normalization>`_
    function depending on the distance :math:`r`
  - :math:`\sigma^2` is the variance
  - :math:`n` is the nugget (subscale variance)

.. note::

   We are not limited to isotropic models. We support anisotropy ratios for
   length scales in orthogonal transversal directions like:

   - :math:`x` (main direction)
   - :math:`y` (1. transversal direction)
   - :math:`z` (2. transversal direction)

   These main directions can also be rotated, but we will come to that later.

Tutorial 3: Variogram Estimation
================================

Estimating the spatial correlations is an important part of geostatistics.
These spatial correlations can be expressed by the variogram, which can be
estimated with the subpackage :any:`gstools.variogram`. The variograms can be
estimated on structured and unstructured grids.

The same `(semi-)variogram <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram#Semivariogram>`_ as
:ref:`tutorial_02_cov` is being used
by this subpackage.
